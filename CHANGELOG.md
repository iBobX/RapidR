# Changelog

All notable changes to RapidR are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the
project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Planned work lives in
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md); security finding IDs (`SEC-xx`) refer to it.

## [2.8.2] — 2026-09-24

Security hardening release (Roadmap Phase 0, Sprint 1).

### Security
- **Build server no longer reachable from the network or from websites (SEC-01, critical).**
  `rapidr-buildserver` compiles arbitrary code, including `RUSTSTART` blocks built with cargo.
  It previously listened on `0.0.0.0` with fully permissive CORS. It now:
  - binds to `127.0.0.1` by default (`RAPIDR_BUILDSERVER_HOST` overrides, with a warning);
  - rejects requests whose `Host` or `Origin` is not loopback, blocking cross-site
    requests and DNS rebinding;
  - only answers CORS preflights from loopback origins.
- **Build server path traversal fixed (SEC-11).** `/preview/<id>/../..` could read files
  outside the build directory; paths with `..` or absolute components are now rejected.
- **JavaScript injection in `RStringList.SaveToFile` fixed (SEC-04).** List contents were
  spliced into `eval`'d JavaScript with incomplete escaping. Downloads now go through a
  Blob URL with the content passed as data.
- **Captions and `PRINT` no longer interpret HTML (SEC-05).** `Caption`/`Text` on buttons
  and other elements used `innerHTML`, and `PRINT` appended to `#rr-console` as HTML, so
  displaying database, HTTP or other untrusted data could inject scripts. Both now use
  plain text. Use `RDOM.InnerHTML` or `RWebView.HTML` when markup is intended.
- **Removed string-built `eval` from the web runtime (SEC-06).** `RHttp.Get/Post`,
  `BEEP` and `SOUND` now call `XMLHttpRequest` and Web Audio through `web_sys`.
  `RJavaScript.Eval` is the only remaining `eval`, by design.
- Added `clippy.toml` banning `js_sys::eval` so it can't be reintroduced accidentally.

### Fixed
- `RHttp`, `BEEP`, `SOUND` and `RStringList.SaveToFile` now work in bundles built by the
  IDE, whose Content-Security-Policy blocks `eval`.
- `RHttp` no longer mis-parses response bodies (the hand-rolled JSON round-trip was removed).
- `BEEP`/`SOUND` reuse one `AudioContext` instead of creating one per call (browsers cap them).

### Added
- `ROADMAP.md` — the plan toward full RapidQ/VB compatibility, the debugger, AI features
  and the security audit.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).

### Verification
- Build server: unit tests for loopback host/origin and path checks; live requests confirmed
  local requests succeed while cross-site, DNS-rebinding and `null`-origin requests get 403.
- Web runtime: a hostile test program (HTML payloads in captions and `PRINT`, an injection
  payload in `SaveToFile`, `RHttp` GET/POST, `BEEP`) run in Chromium both without a CSP and
  under the IDE bundle's CSP — no script execution, no CSP violations, all features working.
- Existing Playwright suites pass: `web_ide_smoke`, `web_ide_e2e` (6/6), `web_ide_designer`,
  `web_ide_debugger_test`.

## [2.8.1] — 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- Dynamic `RDOM` tag swapping to fix background CSS leakage.

## [2.8.0]

### Added
- Visual widget outline, Assets Manager explorer, and module/form identifier
  sanitization suggestions.
